# Udacity Mobile Flashcards Project

This is the final project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

# Concept

- This is a mobile flashcards app
- Users can create flashcard decks and as many flashcards per deck as they would like
- Each flashcard consists of a simple question and answer
- Users can quiz themselves by going through each card in the deck, flipping the card, and self-reporting the results. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown the results of the quiz.

# Instructions
- Clone this repository
- CD into the directory
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies
- Start a development server with `yarn start`
- Download and install [Expo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US) for Android
- Run Expo on your Android device and scan the QR code to launch the app
- Memorize some stuff

# Considerations and Future Features

- This app was developed for Android on a Pixel 2 running Android Pie.
- This app has not been tested on iOS, but support may be added in the future.
- Users cannot delete decks or cards at this time, but functionality will be added eventually.
- Quiz score tracking will be added eventually.
