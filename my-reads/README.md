# MyReads Project

This is the first of three projects for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

## Project Requirements

- Refactor starter code into react components
- Generate 3 different book shelves that hold books in the category of 'currently reading', 'want to read', and 'read'
- The dropdown menu on each book must reflect the current shelf and changing the value should move the book to the corresponding shelf
- Clicking the 'add book' button should change the URL to /search and offer back-button browser functionality
- Typing text into the search field should return books from the BooksAPI
- Search page and book case should reflect the book's current shelf
- Search page has link to root URL
- Tester's machine should mot catch on fire when starting the app

## Added Functionality

- Searchbar appears under My Books heading for a more consistent experience
- Search input field focus automatically set after clicking add button for quick text input
- Added Search Results heading when results are found
- Changed accent color to blue because why not :)

## To run this app

- Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the development server with `npm start`
- Duck and cover

## Notes

- Search terms are limited to the words found in SEARCH_TERMS.md
